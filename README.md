# HowFarTo
A small project to learn about MapBox. A user can click or drag a marker on a map and the application will tell them the distance to Uluru, Australia.
## Usage
1. Get an API token for MapBox [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/get-started-tokens-api/).
2. Clone the repository and create a file called `./token.js` in the root of the directory.
3. Add a single line `const MY_TOKEN = '[token]';` to the file, replacing [token] with with your own.
## Coming soon
This very small project is still a work in progress with a live demo coming soon. :smiley:
