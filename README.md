# HowFarTo
A small project to learn about MapBox.
- A user can click or drag a marker on a map and the application will tell them the distance to Uluru, Australia.
- Using a map layer, a line is dynamically drawn on the map between Uluru and the marker.
- A textbox instructs the user how to use the app.
- A user can use a searchbox to find a location.
## Usage
1. Get an API token for MapBox [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/get-started-tokens-api/).
2. Clone the repository and create a file called `./token.js` in the root of the directory.
3. Add a single line `const MY_TOKEN = '[token]';` to the file, replacing [token] with your own.
## Coming soon
This very small project is still a work in progress with a live demo coming soon. :smiley:
Possible future features:
- Responsive design
- Cleaner design/style
- Contextual descriptive text
- Optionally detect user location
